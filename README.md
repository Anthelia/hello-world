Beginning repository for experimenting and getting used to how things work.

Hi I am a graduate student in Classical Studies and finishing a dissertation on Euripides.  

I have decided I don't want to pursue a career in academia and would like to move into a more relevant field.  
Tech is appealing to me because I like clear concrete goals and creating something that people can use which will make their lives better or more enjoyable.  

I am interested in web-development in general but am eager to try many different things and see what I like best.
